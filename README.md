# MK_KupSkorer

## You'll need to register a user with email5@addr.com, using specialKode = 'mariokart' in order to have a user with permission to create/edit players. Restart the app after registering the user, clear your browser cache, and you should see a new option on the index page to create/edit players.

## If there isn't any seed data, you'll need to create at least 2 players to skore a kup.

##  The idea for the app as well as skoring is detailed on the About page.
Flow consists of selecting 2 - 4 players in the 'Kup', then selecting the winner for each race. This goes through 4 races before dispalying a Kup results page. 

## To see how racers stack up, you can use the Report Kard option and view the one existing report I added at the time of this writing.
